# Weather Data Analysis
This repository contains a dataset from Kaggle and analysis scripts for exploring weather data. The dataset includes various weather-related metrics such as temperature, wind speed, visibility, and weather conditions. The goal of this project is to perform data analysis and derive insights related to weather patterns.

The dataset includes the following columns:

Date Time: Date and time of the observation.
Weather: Weather condition (e.g., Clear, fog , Snow)
Wind Speed_km/h: Wind speed in kilometers per hour.
Visibility_km: Visibility in kilometers.
Rel Hum_%: Relative humidity percentage.
Temp_c: Temperature in celcius
Dew Point Temp_c: Dew point temperature in celcius
Press_kPa: Atmospheric pressure in kilopascals
